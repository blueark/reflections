When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I think remote repositories are useful for collaborative work, or even solo projects
where you might be working on multiple computers (say, work and home). It also provides
an extra layer of security in case your PC breaks down: at least any code that has been
pushed to the remote will still be available.
