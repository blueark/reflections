What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A hidden folder called .git is created, which will contain all the metadata
required to manage version control. Without it, Git commands won't work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area provides an area to choose what files will comprise the next
commit. One advantage is that it lets us keep working on our files in the
working directory, but selectively choose which ones make sense to add to the
repository in the next commit. Not all changed files in the working directory
are necessarily part of the same logical change.
